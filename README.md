# SQL Problems – Real-World Interview Scenarios
This repository contains real-world SQL problems inspired by business scenarios used by different companies to evaluate candidates’ practical SQL skills, curated via InterviewMasterAI. By working through these problems and documenting my solutions, I demonstrate my proficiency in writing clean, efficient, and interview-ready SQL that can handle realistic data challenges faced in analytics and data-driven roles.

### About this Repository
* Problems are based on realistic datasets and use-cases similar to those asked in data and analytics interviews.
* The focus is on translating ambiguous business questions into precise, correct, and optimized SQL queries.
* Scenarios reflect how SQL is used in companies for reporting, product analytics, performance tracking, and decision-making.

### Problem Sources and Inspiration
* Core inspiration comes from InterviewMasterAI’s real-world SQL practice problems and learning roadmap, which emphasize practical, job-relevant skills.
* The questions span multiple difficulty levels, from foundational queries to advanced, scenario-based challenges similar to those used in technical interviews.

> Note: This is a personal practice and portfolio repository, not an official InterviewMasterAI product.

### What This Demonstrates About My Skills
Through this repository, I aim to clearly showcase:
* Strong command of SQL for querying, cleaning, aggregating, and transforming data in a structured way.
* Ability to solve realistic, business-driven SQL problems that mirror interview-style questions and on-the-job tasks.
* A disciplined problem-solving approach, with readable, well-structured queries, meaningful aliases, and comments where helpful.


### Tech Stack
* SQL, with emphasis on SELECT queries, joins, aggregations, window functions, subqueries, and conditional logic.
* Typical interview-style relational schemas, including domains like sales, marketing, product, users, and events.
