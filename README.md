# SQL-Problems

## SQL Problems – Real-World Interview Scenarios
This repository contains real-world SQL problems inspired by business scenarios used by different companies to evaluate candidates’ practical SQL skills, curated via InterviewMasterAI. By working through these problems and documenting my solutions, I demonstrate my proficiency in writing clean, efficient, and interview-ready SQL that can handle realistic data challenges faced in analytics and data-driven roles.

# About this Repository
* Problems are based on realistic datasets and use-cases similar to those asked in data and analytics interviews.
* The focus is on translating ambiguous business questions into precise, correct, and optimized SQL queries.
* Scenarios reflect how SQL is used in companies for reporting, product analytics, performance tracking, and decision-making.

# Problem Sources and Inspiration
* Core inspiration comes from InterviewMasterAI’s real-world SQL practice problems and learning roadmap, which emphasize practical, job-relevant skills.
* The questions span multiple difficulty levels, from foundational queries to advanced, scenario-based challenges similar to those used in technical interviews.

# What This Demonstrates About My Skills
Through this repository, I aim to clearly showcase:

Strong command of SQL for querying, cleaning, aggregating, and transforming data in a structured way.

Ability to solve realistic, business-driven SQL problems that mirror interview-style questions and on-the-job tasks.

A disciplined problem-solving approach, with readable, well-structured queries, meaningful aliases, and comments where helpful.

How to Use This Repo
Clone or download the repository and open the SQL files for each problem and solution.

Recreate the tables or load sample data in your preferred SQL database (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or SQLite).

Attempt each problem on your own first, then compare your solution with mine to understand different approaches, edge cases, and potential optimizations.

Tech Stack
SQL, with emphasis on SELECT queries, joins, aggregations, window functions, subqueries, and conditional logic.

Typical interview-style relational schemas, including domains like sales, marketing, product, users, and events.

Future Enhancements
Add more problems across levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced) to cover a broader range of topics.

Include detailed explanations and step-by-step reasoning for each solution, including performance considerations where relevant.

Tag problems by topic (joins, window functions, CTEs, optimization, data cleaning, etc.) to enable structured and focused practice.
